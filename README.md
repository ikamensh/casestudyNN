experiments in learning Machine Learning / Deep Learning

Experiment1: single neurons:

Assumptions about how a MLP should process forward prop and backprop are tested on small number of neurons and simple numbers


Experiment2: depth:

Problems of vanishing and exploding gradients are investigated.
